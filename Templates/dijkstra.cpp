 *
 * \tparam DistanceType        Type of distances

 * \param firstnode            Node to start search from.
 * \param lastnode             Node to find route to.
 * \param for_all_neighbors_of Functor for enumerating neighbors and distances, see below.
 * \param return_route         Functor for receiving route information, see below.
 *
 * \remark \parblock
 * If `firstnode` = `lastnode`, calculates the shortest route from `firstnode` to every reachable node.
 *
 * `for_all_neighbors_of` must be a functor: void(NodeType source_node, Functor f)
 * which calls `f` with parameters (NodeType target_node, DistanceType d)
 *   for all neighbors of `source_node`, where `target_node` is a neighbor of `source_node`,
 *                              and `d` is the distance from `source_node` to `target_node`.
 *
 * `return_route` must be a functor: void(NodeType target, NodeType source, DistanceType length),
 *   that will be called several times after the search is complete.
 *   `length` is the shortest total distance from `firstnode` node to the `target` node.
 *   `source` is the node through which the shortest route to `target` goes.
 *
 *   If `firstnode` = `lastnode`, or a route to `lastnode` was not found,
 *     This function will be called for every target
 *     that is reachable from firstnode, in an unspecified order.
 *
 *   If `firstnode` is not `lastnode`, and a route to `lastnode` was found,
 *     The function calls comprise the reverse route from `firstnode` to `lastnode`,
 *       with first call having   `target` = `lastnode`,
 *       and the last call having `source` = `firstnode`.
 * \endparblock
 *
 * \returns Shortest total distance from `firstnode` to `lastnode`,
 *          or a default-constructed DistanceType
 *          if no route was found or if `firstnode` = `lastnode`.
